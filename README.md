# EndogenousWeightsJDE
This contains all the stata data set and do files associated with the paper:  Endogenous Weights and Multidimensional Poverty: A Cautionary Tale by Dutta, Nogales and Yalonetzky (2021)
Use of dataset and Stata dofiles:
•	The MPIs for Ecuador and Uganda are estimated, respectively running mpi_ECU.do on mpi_ECU_full.dta, and mpi_UGA.do on mpi_UGA_full.dta
•	The simulation analysis of violations to monotonicity using both real-world datasets is conducted running end_weight_national_09012021.do. The results of these simulations are stored in mpi.dta (main results to reproduce figures)
•	The simulation analysis of violations to subgroup consistency using both real-world datasets is conducted running end_weight_subnat_09012021.do. The results of these simulations are stored in mpi2.dta (main results to reproduce figures)
•	The simulation results of the Monte-Carlo analysis of violations to monotonicity are produced using sims_national_18012021.do
•	The simulation results of the Monte-Carlo analysis of violations to subgroup consistency are produced using sims_subnat_18012021.do
